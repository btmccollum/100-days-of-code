 **Today's Progress:** Started off with a few more code challenges. Tried to finish up my #100DaysofCode project, but still have a bit more to do. Putting the finishing touches on my edit functions as this is being typed. Job search is a bit tougher than I thought.

 **Thoughts:** So excited to finish this project up. I feel like after this, I need to be spending more time on learning/trying new things. While I have learned from these last few projects, I feel like it's more of the same general functionanlity. If I want to get where I want to be, I need to focus on learning more advanced concepts/patterns, languages, frameworks, etc.. Need to keep learning. Tried a hard problem today, and it was maybe a bit too hard for me right now. While I did get a working answer, it was more brute force and far from efficient, so I timed out on a few tests.

 ### Day 43: June 24, 2019

 **Today's Progress:** Worked on adding API integration testing for my #100DaysOfCode app. Decided my next feature will need to be the ability to reset a password by email, which is my first time ever trying this.

 **Thoughts:** Excited to work on this next feature. I've built quite a few apps now, but they've never had the ability to reset password by email which is a basic function any app should have.

 ### R2 Day 60: July 10th, 2019

 **Today's Progress:** Made a short demo for my #100DaysOfCode app, the OHDOC Challenge Manager. Started to develop a few more specs for the app.

 **Thoughts:** Really excited with where this app is at! Happy to write a few more tests and in the meantime I'll be thinking of some new project ideas. Maybe I'll try out something brewery related with GraphQL and Docker this time?
