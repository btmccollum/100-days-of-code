### R2D28: June 7th, 2019

 **Today's Progress:** Started off with a few more code challenges. Tried to finish up my #100DaysofCode project, but still have a bit more to do. Putting the finishing touches on my edit functions as this is being typed. Job search is a bit tougher than I thought.

 **Thoughts:** So excited to finish this project up. I feel like after this, I need to be spending more time on learning/trying new things. While I have learned from these last few projects, I feel like it's more of the same general functionanlity. If I want to get where I want to be, I need to focus on learning more advanced concepts/patterns, languages, frameworks, etc.. Need to keep learning. Tried a hard problem today, and it was maybe a bit too hard for me right now. While I did get a working answer, it was more brute force and far from efficient, so I timed out on a few tests.
