# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Flatiron lessons for asynchronous JavaScript. Started with basic XHR and then AJAX/Callbacks and JS' fetch() method using the GitHub API. Spent quite a bit of time practicing with the GitHub API- pulling repos, creating forks, pulling/posting issues/commits, etc.. 

**Thoughts:** This was my first real exposure to using APIs and it was definitely an interesting learning experience. I feel like I've got a pretty good grasp on the various AJAX/jQuery/vanilla JS involved in pulling from and posting through an API. Biggest lesson today: slow down! I found myself spending a big too much time banging my head against a wall only to realize it was some small mistake in one of my calls. D'oh! Most of my time was spent trying to troubleshoot through the Github API docs rather than my code, as simple as it was. I'd really love to slim down my code and clean it up. I feel like it may still be more messy than I'd like, but hey it's working!

**Time Spent Today:** 8 hours

**Journey Time** 724 hours

### Day 2: January 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started the day working on some HakerRank problems in JS/Ruby and starting their 30 days of code challenge on top of this! Continued to work through the Flatiron JS and Rails/JS coursework later on. Finished the JS section today by learning how to create simple test with Mocha and Sinon, including spies and stubs/mocks. Transitioned back to Rails and starting to learn how to incorporate JS and make use of the Asset Pipeline. Learned the ins and outs of the AP manifest files and how to incorporate some basic CSS/JS into existing projects. Finished the day creating some basic functionality in an app to import CSV files and manipulate the data from them. 

**Thoughts:** It felt good getting through the rest of the basic JS section. I'd like to spend some freetime looking more into JS and increasing my proficiency. Flatiron skims over quite a bit in their section but I need to increase my knowledge further, i feel like there is so much more I could learn about basic JS usage and flesh out some ideas for my Penda app project. Felt pretty good today, no real roadblocks. Definitely happy to be working with Ruby/Rails again, just feels so natural! Will pickup tomorrow working more with Sidekiq and APIs/AJAX in Rails. 

**Time Spent Today:** 8.5 hours

**Journey Time** 732.5 hours

### Day 3: January 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Got a late start today with some at home issues that popped up this morning. Started off the day by completing Day 1 of 30 Days Of Code (HR) and then some additional JS and Ruby problems for practice. After working with Rails so much it's good to get a refresher on some basic Ruby! Explored the use of Sidekiq a bit, which can be used to move long-running tasks off of the main app's thread and minimize user impact (was working with CSV files again). Worked more with Rails and APIs, mainly leveraging Postman to explore, then using implementing Faraday in my Rails app. Primarliy played around with Foursquare and Github APIs in some simple exercises to create a simple user interface to do custom API hits.

**Thoughts:** Despite the late start I felt like it was a productive day, although I didnt get through as many labs as I'd like to have. Working with various APIs is really interesting but can be a headscratcher sometimes when you cant get it to work the way you want. Make sure you're always checking the small stuff, even something as silly as forgetting to use 'https' instead of 'http'. Feel like I've gotten a better feel for using API documentation.

**Time Spent Today:** 7 hours

**Journey Time** 739.5 hours

### Day 4 January 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Typically I dont get as much time in on weekends as I'd like with other obligations, but I wanted to ensure I was at least getting an hour everyday! Spend about and hour and a half working on HackerRank problems to keep myself challenged. Not only did I get to work on some good warmup problems, but I also learned about how to use JS try...catch statements! I can definitely see how they would be handy for error handling in some cases. Also made it through the Day 2 of HR's 30 Days of Code.

**Thoughts:** I feel like these HR or CodeWars challenges are a great daily warm up activity to keep my skills sharp. I've learned A LOT since last August, but these have shown me the importance of keeping on top of some of the basics. Sometimes simple is the right answer, especially from a complexity and run time standpoint. I'm really looking forward to getting into some of the CS concepts and Algorithms. I'd like to start looking into the CS50x coursework.

**Time Spent Today:** 1.5 hours

**Journey Time** 741 hours

### Day 5 January 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Spent my time doing some introductory problems with Algorithms and Data Structures. Definitely took a bit to figure some of the challenges out but they were fun! 

**Thoughts:** Was able to get a bit more done inbetween house work today. Mainly just focused on doing some HackerRank problems, and CodeWars challenges. I find that they're a good way to warm up or challenge myself when I dont have a lot of time to study or commit to a project. Started dealing with triplets and some introductory work with Algorithms and data structures- very interesting! 

**Time Spent Today:** 2 hours

**Journey Time** 743 hours

### Day 6 January 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Mainly spent the day working with various APIs and got practice in making hits and primarily making POST requests. Created a very basic app to let an oauth authenticated user pull a list of their github repos and then create a new repo by entering a name in a text field. Worked with Postman quite a bit too to get some practice additional get/post requests as well. 

**Thoughts:** Definitely feeling more comfortable working with APIs and reading through their documentation. I lost about an hour or so while being stubborn- learning opportunity! In my excitement I misread where you're supposed to request for repo access from a user, and was trying to do it at the time of the post, rather than getting that permission upfront when establishing the user and getting a token. Felt really silly after I realized what was going on, but hey just shows you the importance of taking the time to FULLY read the docs for what you're trying to do and making sure you're in the right section. It really helps to read the getting started section and not just jumping to the parts you're messing with. 

**Time Spent Today:** 9.5 hours

**Journey Time** 750.5 hours

### Day 7 January 8, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about creating web service objects in Rails which help to move some of the API logic outside of the controllers to help your app better adhere to the single responsibility principle. Also start learning to implement AJAX GET/POST requests with Rails to better serve content. Worked on an older app to implement an AJAX post request to create a comment within a project without having to navigate away or lock up the browser. 

**Thoughts:** Rails never ceases to amaze me with all the handy little nuances that make it very user friendly and the asset pipeline has been fun to play with. I'm familiar with some JS (need to learn coffeescript!) and was creating some basic on click functions that would dynamically load a project's comments in the page, or send a post request behind the scenes using AJAX. Still feel like I'm a bit clumsy in creating those requests, but I need to keep learning about how to implement them with my existing application and move some of that out of the Rails stack. 

**Time Spent Today:** 9 hours

**Journey Time** 759.5 hours

### Day 8 January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Picked up from yesterday with API endpoints. Learned about API POSTs with AJAX to dynamically load information from the db without having to redirect or refresh the page. Revisited an old project and used JS to dynamically load the comments on a project, as well as creating new comments without having to navigate off the project page. 

**Thoughts:** It had been a long time since I last messed with JS but it does feel familiar again. I've missed so much and there are so many interesting things that you can do. The Penda project app I started was designed from the beginning to make heavy use of JS so I'm excited to start revamping it in the next week or so after I get through a few more lessons. 

**Time Spent Today:** 5.75 hours

**Journey Time** 765.25 hours

### Day 9 January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More of the same from the last two days, just more practice with AJAX using higher end methods instead of just the low level '.ajax'. I find it really helpful to start at the lowest level operators or methods and work my way up from there. 

**Thoughts:** Loving the addition of JS and making use of the asset pipeline. Curious when we will start pulling the JS scripts out of the individual ERB templates and back into the asset pipeline files for those views/classes/etc instead. 

**Time Spent Today:** 7.5 hours

**Journey Time** 772.75 hours

### Day 10 January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Active Model Serializers today. Installed the AMS gem and created some simple serializers with the rails generate command. Created basic serializers for existing classes and also serializers to display AR associations. 

**Thoughts:** Having access to AMS is sooo much more convenient then having to manually write out eachline for how the serializer should properly display JSON. Not to mention that would quickly become a huge pain with more complex classes. Looking forward to working with AMS more, definitely making things easier. 

**Time Spent Today:** 3.5 hours

**Journey Time** 776.25 hours

### Day 11 January 13, 2019
**NOTE: on 1/12 we had to go out of town for a visit to the countryside. I was told we'd have WIFI access at our location and planned to do some work in the mornings/evenings but that was not the case and instead I had 0 access to anything! 

**Today's Progress**: More practice with AMS to better access JSON formatted data from my models. 

**Thoughts:** Not as productive as a weekend as I was hoping with the internet challenges, however I did get a bit more practice in using AMS. Feeling like I have a pretty solid understanding now of working with JS and Rails ot dynamically render content. I can think of a few handy applications for loading data but I'd to see some best case use scenarios for a more thorough idea of where and how I can implement this properly into projects. 

**Time Spent Today:** 2 hours

**Journey Time** 778.25 hours

### Day 12 January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued to practice receiving API posts. Started work on a simple single page application Tic-Tac-Toe game leveraging jQuery and a Rails API. Finished the backend, now just need to work out the front-end to bring everything together. Should be a good test of what I've praticed the last few days to make use of JS/jQuery/AJAX/JSON/AMS/Rails API.

**Thoughts:** The last week or so has been a bit tough and I havent been able to get in as much time as I normally like to, today especially. Spent some time this morning attending lectures and also getting some pointers on the upcoming career search. Getting excited! Really like where I'm going with AMS and building out a Rails API. I'm coming across so many small things I stumbled across previously and learning how to properly implement them. Feels like a real confidence booster bringing everything together. 

**Time Spent Today:** 6 hours

**Journey Time** 784.25 hours

### Day 13 January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished a lesson for creating a rails based single page app Tic-tac-toe game that heavily leverages jQuery.

**Thoughts:** Felt great finishing out this SPA Rails app. I find myself still trying to overcomplicate some things that should be simple which can be frustrating. For example I spent an embarassing amount of time thinking through a way to pass around an object's ID through the various JS functions depending on whether or not the game had been saved. I initially ended up injecting the id into a hidden input field after retrieving the data with a jQuery get request, only to realize the moment after it would be MUCH simpler to declare it in the JS file as a global variable (d'oh!). Always helps to remind myself to "keep it simple, stupid!" Make sure you're taking breaks and if you feel like you're overthinking things, slow it down a bit and remember the basics.

### Day 14 January 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Sick today so didnt accomplish as much :( Attended a few talks on adding a JS frontend to Rails Apps. Learned something new about ActiveModel Serializers that's pretty handy, you can define a class' instance methods as attributes and pass the return values to JS through JSON! Tomorrow will be my official start to revamping my time tracker/client project application. 

**Thoughts:** Other than being sick all day, I felt satisfied at least I was able to learn a few new things and attend some discussions. The AMS trick was really neat, I hadnt seen that in the documentation but someone else stumbled into it an shared. This may solve my headaches with trying to pass some customized #strftime helpers from rails. Excited to start revamping my project tomorrow and see how much I can get done!

### Day 15 January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made some minor changes to my application to incorporate Ajax into the first few welcome pages. Working on making a dynamic login and signup experience.

**Thoughts:** Originally when I designed my app, my root page gave the user two options to either sign up or log in. If they hit sign up they were redirected to an identical page with business user or standard user options. Depending on what they chose, they would be redirected to a signup form. With the help of Ajax I'm now replacing that HTML on the DOM to give them those same options, which was pretty simple to do. The trouble I started to run into was after going 'log in' and then trying to make an AJAX post from there, for some reason I'm not able to intercept that action and I think it has something to do with overriding the DOM to begin with to get to that point, but I'll experiment more with that tomorrow. Tomorrow I'm setting some goals for myself to get the Login and Signup pages converted to AJAX requests for a more dynamic feel. I feel like I just need one to work and then the other 2 will come very quickly. If that goes well then I can start working on the big one- the project entries! Trying to think ahead about how I'm going to model these JS domain objects, something I'm still not super comfortable with. Should be a great learning experience! Just need to remember when to stop being stubborn and explore other avenues.

### Day 16 January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Got almost all of my Project's JS taken care of, the JS Projects class is built out with its constructor and a few prototype methods added on. From my dashboard view I'm able to dynamically render a list of a user's projects with 3 different filters for all/active/completed. I'm also able to get a Project itself to load dynamically. I'll revisit the login process tomorrow now that I have a better grasp on how I'm going to have to set this up around my rails structure. 

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty excited with today's progress! The Projects piece is the cornerstone for working into the rest, as everything else depends on or loads within it. Working pretty well right now. From here I have a few things to finish up with projects, then I'll start needing to handle the forms within the projects page and then revisit the user information. One thing I need to invest some more time into is knowing what and what does not need to be dynamically rendered with Ajax vs just the normal rails redirects. I understand this project is sort of a weird hybrid of Rails and JS without a dedicated frontend, but there are still some interesting lessons to learn here. I'll be learning React soon enough!

**Journey Time** 808.75 hours

### Day 17 January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the JS Projects class and some of its prototypes. I was able to make it so I can load my dashboard through Ajax get request, then dynamically render a project show view from there, while reassigning my binds so that the embedded new comment form will still work after the ajax call, which was an issues before. 

**Thoughts:** Spent most of my time figuring out how I could make it so my JS and event listeners continued to work after an AJAX request. I had a feeling that was the issue but couldnt put a finger on it, but now I know! It probably isn't the best way to go about it, but with the way I had my pages set up on Rails I figured I could essentially set up my yield inside of a .js-Content container and the append the results of the AJAX get into that container with #load() and targetting the same container on the returned page. Not the cleanest I think, but for now it works!

**Time Spent Today:** 2.5 hours

**Journey Time** 811.25 hours

### Day 18 January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit more on the projects.js file. Got a few additional attributes added to the constructor to store the return values of the Ruby class' instance methods. Cleaned up the existing prototypes and removed their reliance on a const declared within the file, instead the prototypes now redeclare the current project for use within itself. 

Side note, started the CS50x course to get a better grasp on data structures and algorithms. Very excited! I'll start spending a few hours with this on the weekends, at the very least. I feel like I should have spent some time upfront doing this. 

**Thoughts:** I learned the other day that you can pass in the return values of Ruby instance methods through a serializer to be utilized in JS which solved my problem of making sure the Ruby and JS time/date displays matched up identically. Now I can use the same methods I was using on the Rails side to dynamically display my content. I feel pretty good with where Projects is going. I have a few more prototypes to add but from there I should be able to move on to time entries and start working on the timer.

**Time Spent Today:** 1.5 hours

**Journey Time** 812.75 hours

### Day 19 January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Got a bit more work done on my projects show page. I got the time entries buttons and functions taken care of. I can now dynamically render the Time Entries new and index actions from the dashboard show page

**Thoughts:** I feel a bit conflicted about how this continues to evolve. Originally this project involved just Rails, but now wants more emphasis on JS classes and prototypes, Ajax requests and so on. It feels a little wonky to me having robust views built out in Rails and then finding ways to inject JS. Right now I'm really just redoing the same work in JS on top of what I already have and not really utilizing the Rails content other than pulling over some views from the jQuery load() method to make use of some of that logic that was already built in. Maybe it's just me? I feel like this is a sort of inbetween that doesnt or shouldnt happen that often, as opposed to utilizing Rails purely for back end and making use of a true front end framework like React.

**Journey Time** 818.25 hours

### Day 20 January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished mapping out the rest of my JS classes to mirror my Rails models, other than users. Added a few more prototypes to the JS Project class and the new TimeEntry class. Pretty much everything about Projects now dynamically renders other than the comments delete action! 

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as far as I would have liked to have today. I got sidetracked by a lot of issues trying to get my Project's comments resource to dynamically delete comments. Got close but not quite working the way it should. Tried with .ajax(), .post(), and fetch(). However I do feel like I gained a lot more comfort using the three of those! One other cool thing was that I learned about pushState() which can be used to change the user's history (url in address bar) without redirecting to it, so that a user will be able to refresh the same page that was retrieved by the ajax get request. I also made use of popstate which gets applied when pushState() is used. For example if you use pushState() and then hit the browser's back button, a popstate is applied and by making use of window.historyInitiated we can make it so the browser reloads the previous content and avoids some of the wonkyness with pushState().

### Day 21 January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally got my dynamic delete request working for projects.js!! Cleaned up some of the other JS files. Messed around with pagination for a bit but didnt make much progress before working on the meat of my project again. 

**Thoughts:** Really happy I can finally put the issues with the comments delete conumdrum behing me. Figure out that I had been trying to treat it like I was serializing data from a form, however when I originally set up the delete option on the erb template I had done it through an anchor tag instead. I needed to set up an event listener to handle that click and fire off the delete from there. Feel kind of silly it took me that long to realize what was happening. Love debugging, really forces you to think and really tests those problem solving skills. This is all making me really look forward to working with a front end framework so I can move away from these hybrid applications.

**Journey Time** 834.25 hours

### Day 22 January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the MVP for the JS portion of the Penda App for now. The Time Entry links now dynamically render the Time Entry show view. I was able to get the projects.js Project class to instantiate js objects for all of the comments and time entries that belong to the defined project. 

**Thoughts:** Felt great getting the majority of my JS implemented that I had set out for. There is still plenty to do however! I plan on revisiting this project later on to really build out the timers and make them work as originally intended. For now I feel like this was definitely a great mini-project to get some hands on experience with dynamically rendering information through Ajax calls, working with the JSON api / data, and getting used to ES6 features/syntax and class constructors. Onwards to React/Redux!

**Time Spent Today:** 7 hours

**Journey Time** 841.25 hours

### Day 23 January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Covered some introductory information about the Node Package Manager, general use, and how package.json files are created. Moved to React and generated some very small sample static pages making use of React Components. Then introduced some dynamic components that made use of recursion. 

**Thoughts:** Super excited for React! I've heard quite a few negatives about how difficult it is to get into. So far it feels very intuitive and I'm really pumped about components and what I'll be able to create using them as building blocks. I'll be spending the next few days doing a deep dive on React material and then trying to build out some small projects. I'll take some time tomorrow to try and read through the full docs. 

**Time Spent Today:** 6 hours

**Journey Time** 847.25 hours

### Day 24 January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did a bit more work with some introductory React material. Learned about lists and keys and did some work with some small examples to render some sample cards for movies with a front and back. Learned a bit more in-depth information about props in React, their purpose, and how they work.

**Thoughts:** Didnt get to as much as I would have liked, but the weekends are always a bit difficult. I was able to make my way deeper into the React documentation and learn about lists/keys and more about props. I initially misread what the purpose of a key is, attempting to use it as a hash symbol of sorts before realizing it is used as a unique identifier for React to be able to monitor changes and from there everything clicked. Props so far have been pretty easy, I have found them to be rather straightforward so far. It is really cool seeing some of the things you can do with React. 

**Time Spent Today:** 2.25 hours

**Journey Time** 849.5 hours

### Day 25 January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some basic labs on React props. Spent the rest of my time on Saturday sifting through the React documentation to continue to get a grasp on React. 

**Thoughts:** So far so good! Loving what I've seen of React so far, and cant wait to start putting components and props to further use. I love how React modularizes everything. Although I've only played around with some very simple applications or examples, I can't wait to see some larger and more complex projects and how modules are leveraged. 

**Time Spent Today:** 2 hours

**Journey Time** 851.5 hours

### Day 26 January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent the majority of the day focusing on some professional development activities related to software development- I am in the middle of a career change afterall! Worked through some documentation on state and modular code, also got a crash course into how React handles event listeners.  Also passed the first two parts of my Rails/JS assessment! Part three is scheduled for Wednesday-- excited! 

**Thoughts:** The closer I get to looking for my first job in this field, the more excited I get. In the end I know I am going to be much more fulfilled in this industry and field compared to what I was doing before. Although I spent quite a bit of time on professional development, I still made time to get some React studies done. State is pretty interesting so far, even though I haven't done too much. Worked on some small examples, learning about setting state in a constructor because it is the first thing that runs in a component, and then manipulate state with the setState() method. Also learned about some of the other ways that import and export can be used to pass around classes of functions, and I thought you really just handled that with a generic 'export default Class' call, pretty cool how you can pass all functions from a file or just specific ones and pull them in elsewhere. Loving the modularization. 

**Time Spent Today:**  7.25 hours

**Journey Time** 858.75 hours

### Day 27 January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a few more React lessons, primarily focusing on establishing the initial state of a component in the constructor, and using callbacks and passing them down to a parent's child components to make changes up and down the structure in React. 

**Thoughts:** The way that React components handle props and callback functions is really interesting. Took me a bit to get the hang of setting them up, but I feel more comfortable with them now. It is 'taboo' to pass functions or props between components, rather a prop should be passed from parent to child, and call back down to child, at which the originating component (parent) can be effected by execution of that function in the child for whatever criteria it uses. In this exercise I had to set some additional attributes in the intial state, pass a callback down to one component to capture which color was clicked, and then set that in the parent's state, and then pass that back to another component to then take the cell that was clicked and change it's state color from the old one to the new one returned by the callback. Very cool! Looking forward to being able to spend a lot more time with React. Finishing up part two of my JavaScript assessment tomorrow and then I'll be working with React full time.

### Day 28 January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent more time learning about React's SyntheticEvent wrapper and working through some practical applications. Also worked more with state, especially updating state and getting some hands on experience with how it works. Learned about the differences between state and props. 

**Thoughts:**: Trying to wrap your head around state updates to deeply nested objects can be a bit dizzying at first. So many references to 'this' and spread operators as you make your way down for that one value, but I feel pretty comfortable with it now! Just had to see it work properly one time and I've got the jist of it. Events are pretty easy to work with in React and I really like how the SyntheticEvent wrapper works, makes it pretty easy and straightforward.

### Day 29 January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Studied up on the React Component lifecycle and the lifecycle hooks made available by React. Did a few excercises to work with different lifecycle hooks in all three stages, mounting/updating/unmounting.

**Thoughts:**: Really loving React! The power of components is pretty cool, especially all of the options they provide to a developer and how efficiently they work from a user standpoint. More React please! Oh and I also passed my Flatiron assessment for the Rails/JS project, yay!

### Day 30 February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some async react exercises to practice more with React lifecycle hooks and dynamic rendering of fetched content.

**Thoughts:**: Got really derailed on my schedule today with a mattress delivery and then having to clean and rearrange two rooms, but tomorrow will be my Friday instead! React lifecycle hooks are pretty cool in the customization they can offer you and I can already picture a bunch of uses for componentDidMount().

### Day 31 February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More practice with async React fundamentals. Completed a mini project exercise that made use of class components to communicate with the Giphy API to retrieve GIFs based on the user's search terms. This made use of several different components: a larger container component that would handle the gifs list retrieved from the fetch call, a gifsearch component and another to render the results. 

**Thoughts:**: Feeling more and more comfortable with React class components. Tomorrow I'll start looking at the other types of components more indepth, Pure Components and Functional Components. I'd like to start my own separate side project to even further reinforce these ideas and what I'm learning. Just need to think of something that would be interesting to work with! More coming on that soon hopefully.

### Day 32 February 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed a few exercises on advanced React Components, primarily focusing on the difference between concepts for presentational vs container components. Implemented some React Fragments into the exercise. Created a very simple mini-app that interfaced with the NYTimes Movies API to display the latest movie reviews and return results from a user query that were then passed down to functional stateless components to render the results.

**Thoughts:**: Still loving React and the whole concept of components. They can be a bit tricky to figure out the ins and outs with them when you start working with some more complex set ups, but the things you can create with them are really cool. I especially like how much they seperate out concerns. Talk about single responsibility principle! I feel like components really embody that concents. I'd love to see a React app on the scale of Facebook and see just how many components they make use of.

### Day 33 February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time with React under the hood, mainly how Babel functions and Webpack. Moved on to how React utilizes declarative programming and the virtual DOM as well. Finished the day working on some exercises that demonstrate client-side routing by making used of the React-Router-DOM library. 

**Thoughts:**: Very interesting to spend some time with React 'under the hood' so to speak, but I wish I was less tired while going through the material tonight, so much to pick up on and it is fascinating. Spent some time on client-side routing and designing single page applications (SPA). It's funny seeing the discussion of pushState() when I was using it on my previous Rails/JS hybrid so I kind of created a mini simulation of state.

### Day 34 February 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started the day learning about routing and nested routing in vanilla React. Then started the coursework on Redux and will start incorporating that soon! 

**Thoughts:**: In the homestretch of the Flatiron curriculum, getting pretty excited to be nearing the end but also about anxious about a new career search-- this is what I've been working for the last 6 months since leaving my previous career to pursue this!! As far as initial thoughts on Redux, I really like the idea of having one POJO that is separated out from the React components to handle state, in theory it sounds way easier to keep track of state and make/track changes that way vs a really sticky system of nested routes and props.

### Day 35 February 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did some light reading on Redux dispatch, initial dispatch, actions, reducer, and the Redux Store. Completed an exercise showing off reducer functions and then another that introduced a very simple example of the createStore() function and how state is handled with Redux.

**Thoughts:**: Really excited to get deeper into the Redux Store. I think it's very exciting that I'm about to implement such a powerful feature. I watched some of Dan Abramov's key note speeches from 2015/2016 around the creation of Redux and it was pretty fascinating stuff. I'm excited to see what kind of things I can come up with to create some small scale React projects that revolve around a few fun APIs.

### Day 36 February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Set up React DevTools and the chrome extension, what a handy tool! Completed a lab to walkthrough setting up the Redux library, how to use Provider and Connect to set up the Redux store. Got under the hood, so to speak, with Provider and Connect() middleware from the React-Redux library to see how exactly they function and how state changes are monitored and relevant portions sent back to the component being used. Learned about mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps. Worked with combineReducers().

**Thoughts:**: Really looking forward to a project to implement all of these concepts, it really is cool the power that React/Redux provide and I'm actively looking for some fun APIs to make some mini projects, especially for my upcoming assessment. Feeling pretty good with Redux, some things are a bit tricky. I feel like combineReducers() makes sense and it wasn't too bad to implement on a smaller scale but I can see why it's so powerful when you start dealing with larger apps, I can only imagine how many lines of code you'd need and the mess you'd be dealing with without it.

### Day 37 February 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Mainly reinforced lessons from the previous few days to help build a more solid level of comfort with React/Redux. Worked on a few exercises to incorporate Redux into forms, and to understand how they work when using multiple resources with combineReducers(). 

**Thoughts:**: The React/Redux community has been super helpful as I've been trying to get a grasp on incorporating React. One of redux's maintainers provided some very helpful resources I'd recommend to anyone learning:

### Day 38 February 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on a short exercise introducing some basic CRUD patterns with Redux. Implemented a few other actions of my own to further test it with different components. 

**Thoughts:**: So far Redux hasnt been too bad to implement on a small scale, although I feel like that kind of defeats the purpose of using Redux since these are smaller scale applications with simple state that wouldnt necessarily require a store and that level of abstraction.

### Day 39 February 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Completed some simple exercises showing off how to set up delete actions in React/Redux. More personal development than coding today.  

**Thoughts:**: Spent most of my time today on personal development to get ready to start a search for my new career :) I did get some time in to practice CRUD actions in React/Redux, more to come tomorrow once I get some thorough experience with it.

### Day 40 February 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Completed an exercise to build out CRUD functionality in a sample app dealing with restaurant postings and reviews. Newly added restaurant components have a review container embedded within them which render a form to generate user reviews and display that list below the form.

**Thoughts:**: This exercise was really good practice for getting used to building out CRUD apps with React/Redux. I feel like Redux might be a bit overkill for this type of app but nevertheless it is good practice for adjusting. I need to get in and finish the ability to update restaurant/review entries, which is just a matter of adding an edit button that fires off a dispatch for the "UPDATE_X" actions for each respective reducer. Once that is updated, then it's just a matter of returning a new state that makes use of map() to find an object with a matching ID and update said object.

### Day 41 February 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Completed some exercises that introduced applyMiddleware and Thunk for more efficient async requests. 

**Thoughts:**: Ready for my project! Took a minute to get a solid grasp on thunk and setting up async requests. This upcoming project should help reinforce those gaps. Took me a little bit to debug some odd issues. I kept getting an error back for a while referencing Objects being returned from my componentDidUpdate() fetch call, but what it really ended up being was my dev tools setup in createStore. To fix it I ended up having to wrap it with compose().

### Day 42 February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Started on a personal project today. Got the initial repos set up on Github and linked to some bare bones apps. Creating my own take on a Reddit feed with a React/Redux front end and Rails API for the back end.

**Thoughts:**: Excited to get started on this project. Decided to start with the backend first. I've set up some minor API endpoints with Rails before but never a full on Rails API for a backend, so this will be a good learning experience. Picked up some quick tips from youtube videos about setting up a Rails API. I feel pretty comfortable about most of the things I need to do other than OAuth, that one is throwing me for a bit of a loop with this set up but I'll work through that tomorrow. Decided to make use of the Devise gem this time and its built in OAuth support. Reddit requires OAuth tokens for everything, so I'm going to need to figure out the best way going about that process. There isnt a known OAuth Reddit provider so I'm thinking I may need to have a standard login process, or at the least implement Facebook/Google and then ask the user to login with their Reddit info and authorize from there? More to come on that tomorrow.

### Day 43 February 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Attended some local networking events with Flatiron. Spent a few hours researching for this project, mainly how to go about using a separate Rails API and React Frontend. 

**Thoughts:**: This is the first time I've done anything like this, so a good test of my ability to figure things out just with some good ol' Google-fu. Unfortunately most readily accessible resources around doing this are oriented for Python, which appears to have a very robust Reddit wrapper called PRAW. Wish I could use that!

### Day 44 February 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I was able to create a successful connection with the Reddit API and obtain an access token through the Rails API.

**Thoughts:**: This one was a pretty big challenge to get working properly. There were a few challenges here. Reddit's OAuth flow is unlike any other I've dealt with. There was only one provider gem and it was outdated which created some other complications. I was able to get that working, it looked like the issues was the removal of a callback_url from the oauth gem to better support OAuth2. I had to create several controller actions to create custome defined query params to pass to reddit with their scopes that were needed.

### Day 45 February 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Got most of the authentication flow figured out and set up. Started working on React/Redux state to store current user.

**Thoughts:**: Still having some challenged with the auth flow given Reddit's unique OAuth set up and lack of gems/support which makes it very challenging. Also doesnt help this is my first time using Devise AND doing it in a Rails API setting which has been a bit complicated initially. 

A problem I started running into was that the Reddit API only returns a username, not an email, and there is no way to obtain that without manually scraping it. This caused an issue with Devise authentication. It's probably not the most elegant solution but what I established as a work around is the following flow: A user is prompted to sign up and creates a very basic account using an email and password combination. What I want to do next is present them with the option to link their reddit account, which will use the OAuth flow. Once they click the link a POST request is sent to my Rails API to generate the query params required by Reddit and a redirect URL. 

That information is then returned to React as JSON, at which point the window is force redirected to Reddit's authorization page to obtain permissions. Once they accept, they are sent to the callback url which is picked up by the Rails API in the Devise/Omniauth Users controller to update the User object with the information obtained from Reddit to build out a full profile.

So far it works, but hopefully there wont be any more surprises. This one has really been a challenge to figure out how to make it work so far. Hopefully it works and I can move on to the actual meat of the application!

### Day 46 February 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Cleaned up some unnecessary code in my API and front end. Did some light reading about how to approach DS/Algorithm problems.    

**Thoughts:**: Nothing of note today! Took a bit of time to clean up some unneeded code from my repos which was just adding clutter for now. I'll jump back in tomorrow and hopefully be able to finish out my authentication process. I still feel better about my new approach, hopefully there are no hiccups trying to get the user information back to the front end. That may require some toying with to get it right.
