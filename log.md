# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Flatiron lessons for asynchronous JavaScript. Started with basic XHR and then AJAX/Callbacks and JS' fetch() method using the GitHub API. Spent quite a bit of time practicing with the GitHub API- pulling repos, creating forks, pulling/posting issues/commits, etc.. 

**Thoughts:** This was my first real exposure to using APIs and it was definitely an interesting learning experience. I feel like I've got a pretty good grasp on the various AJAX/jQuery/vanilla JS involved in pulling from and posting through an API. Biggest lesson today: slow down! I found myself spending a big too much time banging my head against a wall only to realize it was some small mistake in one of my calls. D'oh! Most of my time was spent trying to troubleshoot through the Github API docs rather than my code, as simple as it was. I'd really love to slim down my code and clean it up. I feel like it may still be more messy than I'd like, but hey it's working!

**Time Spent Today:** 8 hours
**Journey Time** 724 hours

### Day 2: January 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started the day working on some HakerRank problems in JS/Ruby and starting their 30 days of code challenge on top of this! Continued to work through the Flatiron JS and Rails/JS coursework later on. Finished the JS section today by learning how to create simple test with Mocha and Sinon, including spies and stubs/mocks. Transitioned back to Rails and starting to learn how to incorporate JS and make use of the Asset Pipeline. Learned the ins and outs of the AP manifest files and how to incorporate some basic CSS/JS into existing projects. Finished the day creating some basic functionality in an app to import CSV files and manipulate the data from them. 

**Thoughts:** It felt good getting through the rest of the basic JS section. I'd like to spend some freetime looking more into JS and increasing my proficiency. Flatiron skims over quite a bit in their section but I need to increase my knowledge further, i feel like there is so much more I could learn about basic JS usage and flesh out some ideas for my Penda app project. Felt pretty good today, no real roadblocks. Definitely happy to be working with Ruby/Rails again, just feels so natural! Will pickup tomorrow working more with Sidekiq and APIs/AJAX in Rails. 

**Time Spent Today:** 8.5 hours
**Journey Time** 732.5 hours

### Day 3: January 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Got a late start today with some at home issues that popped up this morning. Started off the day by completing Day 1 of 30 Days Of Code (HR) and then some additional JS and Ruby problems for practice. After working with Rails so much it's good to get a refresher on some basic Ruby! Explored the use of Sidekiq a bit, which can be used to move long-running tasks off of the main app's thread and minimize user impact (was working with CSV files again). Worked more with Rails and APIs, mainly leveraging Postman to explore, then using implementing Faraday in my Rails app. Primarliy played around with Foursquare and Github APIs in some simple exercises to create a simple user interface to do custom API hits.

**Thoughts:** Despite the late start I felt like it was a productive day, although I didnt get through as many labs as I'd like to have. Working with various APIs is really interesting but can be a headscratcher sometimes when you cant get it to work the way you want. Make sure you're always checking the small stuff, even something as silly as forgetting to use 'https' instead of 'http'. Feel like I've gotten a better feel for using API documentation.

### Day 4 January 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Typically I dont get as much time in on weekends as I'd like with other obligations, but I wanted to ensure I was at least getting an hour everyday! Spend about and hour and a half working on HackerRank problems to keep myself challenged. Not only did I get to work on some good warmup problems, but I also learned about how to use JS try...catch statements! I can definitely see how they would be handy for error handling in some cases. Also made it through the Day 2 of HR's 30 Days of Code.

**Thoughts:** I feel like these HR or CodeWars challenges are a great daily warm up activity to keep my skills sharp. I've learned A LOT since last August, but these have shown me the importance of keeping on top of some of the basics. Sometimes simple is the right answer, especially from a complexity and run time standpoint. I'm really looking forward to getting into some of the CS concepts and Algorithms. I'd like to start looking into the CS50x coursework.

**Time Spent Today:** 1.5 hours
