# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Flatiron lessons for asynchronous JavaScript. Started with basic XHR and then AJAX/Callbacks and JS' fetch() method using the GitHub API. Spent quite a bit of time practicing with the GitHub API- pulling repos, creating forks, pulling/posting issues/commits, etc.. 

**Thoughts:** This was my first real exposure to using APIs and it was definitely an interesting learning experience. I feel like I've got a pretty good grasp on the various AJAX/jQuery/vanilla JS involved in pulling from and posting through an API. Biggest lesson today: slow down! I found myself spending a big too much time banging my head against a wall only to realize it was some small mistake in one of my calls. D'oh! Most of my time was spent trying to troubleshoot through the Github API docs rather than my code, as simple as it was. I'd really love to slim down my code and clean it up. I feel like it may still be more messy than I'd like, but hey it's working!

**Time Spent Today:** 8 hours
**Journey Time** 724 hours

### Day 2: January 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started the day working on some HakerRank problems in JS/Ruby and starting their 30 days of code challenge on top of this! Continued to work through the Flatiron JS and Rails/JS coursework later on. Finished the JS section today by learning how to create simple test with Mocha and Sinon, including spies and stubs/mocks. Transitioned back to Rails and starting to learn how to incorporate JS and make use of the Asset Pipeline. Learned the ins and outs of the AP manifest files and how to incorporate some basic CSS/JS into existing projects. Finished the day creating some basic functionality in an app to import CSV files and manipulate the data from them. 

**Thoughts:** It felt good getting through the rest of the basic JS section. I'd like to spend some freetime looking more into JS and increasing my proficiency. Flatiron skims over quite a bit in their section but I need to increase my knowledge further, i feel like there is so much more I could learn about basic JS usage and flesh out some ideas for my Penda app project. Felt pretty good today, no real roadblocks. Definitely happy to be working with Ruby/Rails again, just feels so natural! Will pickup tomorrow working more with Sidekiq and APIs/AJAX in Rails. 

**Time Spent Today:** 8.5 hours
**Journey Time** 732.5 hours

### Day 3: January 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Got a late start today with some at home issues that popped up this morning. Started off the day by completing Day 1 of 30 Days Of Code (HR) and then some additional JS and Ruby problems for practice. After working with Rails so much it's good to get a refresher on some basic Ruby! Explored the use of Sidekiq a bit, which can be used to move long-running tasks off of the main app's thread and minimize user impact (was working with CSV files again). Worked more with Rails and APIs, mainly leveraging Postman to explore, then using implementing Faraday in my Rails app. Primarliy played around with Foursquare and Github APIs in some simple exercises to create a simple user interface to do custom API hits.

**Thoughts:** Despite the late start I felt like it was a productive day, although I didnt get through as many labs as I'd like to have. Working with various APIs is really interesting but can be a headscratcher sometimes when you cant get it to work the way you want. Make sure you're always checking the small stuff, even something as silly as forgetting to use 'https' instead of 'http'. Feel like I've gotten a better feel for using API documentation.

### Day 4 January 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Typically I dont get as much time in on weekends as I'd like with other obligations, but I wanted to ensure I was at least getting an hour everyday! Spend about and hour and a half working on HackerRank problems to keep myself challenged. Not only did I get to work on some good warmup problems, but I also learned about how to use JS try...catch statements! I can definitely see how they would be handy for error handling in some cases. Also made it through the Day 2 of HR's 30 Days of Code.

**Thoughts:** I feel like these HR or CodeWars challenges are a great daily warm up activity to keep my skills sharp. I've learned A LOT since last August, but these have shown me the importance of keeping on top of some of the basics. Sometimes simple is the right answer, especially from a complexity and run time standpoint. I'm really looking forward to getting into some of the CS concepts and Algorithms. I'd like to start looking into the CS50x coursework.

**Time Spent Today:** 1.5 hours
**Journey Time** 741 hours

### Day 5 January 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Spent my time doing some introductory problems with Algorithms and Data Structures. Definitely took a bit to figure some of the challenges out but they were fun! 

**Thoughts:** Was able to get a bit more done inbetween house work today. Mainly just focused on doing some HackerRank problems, and CodeWars challenges. I find that they're a good way to warm up or challenge myself when I dont have a lot of time to study or commit to a project. Started dealing with triplets and some introductory work with Algorithms and data structures- very interesting! 

**Time Spent Today:** 2 hours
**Journey Time** 743 hours

### Day 6 January 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Mainly spent the day working with various APIs and got practice in making hits and primarily making POST requests. Created a very basic app to let an oauth authenticated user pull a list of their github repos and then create a new repo by entering a name in a text field. Worked with Postman quite a bit too to get some practice additional get/post requests as well. 

**Thoughts:** Definitely feeling more comfortable working with APIs and reading through their documentation. I lost about an hour or so while being stubborn- learning opportunity! In my excitement I misread where you're supposed to request for repo access from a user, and was trying to do it at the time of the post, rather than getting that permission upfront when establishing the user and getting a token. Felt really silly after I realized what was going on, but hey just shows you the importance of taking the time to FULLY read the docs for what you're trying to do and making sure you're in the right section. It really helps to read the getting started section and not just jumping to the parts you're messing with. 

**Time Spent Today:** 9.5 hours
**Journey Time** 750.5 hours

### Day 7 January 8, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about creating web service objects in Rails which help to move some of the API logic outside of the controllers to help your app better adhere to the single responsibility principle. Also start learning to implement AJAX GET/POST requests with Rails to better serve content. Worked on an older app to implement an AJAX post request to create a comment within a project without having to navigate away or lock up the browser. 

**Thoughts:** Rails never ceases to amaze me with all the handy little nuances that make it very user friendly and the asset pipeline has been fun to play with. I'm familiar with some JS (need to learn coffeescript!) and was creating some basic on click functions that would dynamically load a project's comments in the page, or send a post request behind the scenes using AJAX. Still feel like I'm a bit clumsy in creating those requests, but I need to keep learning about how to implement them with my existing application and move some of that out of the Rails stack. 

**Time Spent Today:** 9 hours
**Journey Time** 759.5 hours

### Day 8 January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Picked up from yesterday with API endpoints. Learned about API POSTs with AJAX to dynamically load information from the db without having to redirect or refresh the page. Revisited an old project and used JS to dynamically load the comments on a project, as well as creating new comments without having to navigate off the project page. 

**Thoughts:** It had been a long time since I last messed with JS but it does feel familiar again. I've missed so much and there are so many interesting things that you can do. The Penda project app I started was designed from the beginning to make heavy use of JS so I'm excited to start revamping it in the next week or so after I get through a few more lessons. 

**Time Spent Today:** 5.75 hours
**Journey Time** 765.25 hours

### Day 9 January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More of the same from the last two days, just more practice with AJAX using higher end methods instead of just the low level '.ajax'. I find it really helpful to start at the lowest level operators or methods and work my way up from there. 

**Thoughts:** Loving the addition of JS and making use of the asset pipeline. Curious when we will start pulling the JS scripts out of the individual ERB templates and back into the asset pipeline files for those views/classes/etc instead. 

**Time Spent Today:** 7.5 hours
**Journey Time** 772.75 hours

### Day 10 January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Active Model Serializers today. Installed the AMS gem and created some simple serializers with the rails generate command. Created basic serializers for existing classes and also serializers to display AR associations. 

**Thoughts:** Having access to AMS is sooo much more convenient then having to manually write out eachline for how the serializer should properly display JSON. Not to mention that would quickly become a huge pain with more complex classes. Looking forward to working with AMS more, definitely making things easier. 

**Time Spent Today:** 3.5 hours
**Journey Time** 776.25 hours

### Day 11 January 13, 2019
**NOTE: on 1/12 we had to go out of town for a visit to the countryside. I was told we'd have WIFI access at our location and planned to do some work in the mornings/evenings but that was not the case and instead I had 0 access to anything! 

**Today's Progress**: More practice with AMS to better access JSON formatted data from my models. 

**Thoughts:** Not as productive as a weekend as I was hoping with the internet challenges, however I did get a bit more practice in using AMS. Feeling like I have a pretty solid understanding now of working with JS and Rails ot dynamically render content. I can think of a few handy applications for loading data but I'd to see some best case use scenarios for a more thorough idea of where and how I can implement this properly into projects. 

**Time Spent Today:** 2 hours
**Journey Time** 778.25 hours

### Day 12 January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued to practice receiving API posts. Started work on a simple single page application Tic-Tac-Toe game leveraging jQuery and a Rails API. Finished the backend, now just need to work out the front-end to bring everything together. Should be a good test of what I've praticed the last few days to make use of JS/jQuery/AJAX/JSON/AMS/Rails API.

**Thoughts:** The last week or so has been a bit tough and I havent been able to get in as much time as I normally like to, today especially. Spent some time this morning attending lectures and also getting some pointers on the upcoming career search. Getting excited! Really like where I'm going with AMS and building out a Rails API. I'm coming across so many small things I stumbled across previously and learning how to properly implement them. Feels like a real confidence booster bringing everything together. 

**Time Spent Today:** 6 hours
**Journey Time** 784.25 hours

### Day 13 January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished a lesson for creating a rails based single page app Tic-tac-toe game that heavily leverages jQuery.

**Thoughts:** Felt great finishing out this SPA Rails app. I find myself still trying to overcomplicate some things that should be simple which can be frustrating. For example I spent an embarassing amount of time thinking through a way to pass around an object's ID through the various JS functions depending on whether or not the game had been saved. I initially ended up injecting the id into a hidden input field after retrieving the data with a jQuery get request, only to realize the moment after it would be MUCH simpler to declare it in the JS file as a global variable (d'oh!). Always helps to remind myself to "keep it simple, stupid!" Make sure you're taking breaks and if you feel like you're overthinking things, slow it down a bit and remember the basics.

### Day 14 January 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Sick today so didnt accomplish as much :( Attended a few talks on adding a JS frontend to Rails Apps. Learned something new about ActiveModel Serializers that's pretty handy, you can define a class' instance methods as attributes and pass the return values to JS through JSON! Tomorrow will be my official start to revamping my time tracker/client project application. 

**Thoughts:** Other than being sick all day, I felt satisfied at least I was able to learn a few new things and attend some discussions. The AMS trick was really neat, I hadnt seen that in the documentation but someone else stumbled into it an shared. This may solve my headaches with trying to pass some customized #strftime helpers from rails. Excited to start revamping my project tomorrow and see how much I can get done!
