# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Flatiron lessons for asynchronous JavaScript. Started with basic XHR and then AJAX/Callbacks and JS' fetch() method using the GitHub API. Spent quite a bit of time practicing with the GitHub API- pulling repos, creating forks, pulling/posting issues/commits, etc.. 

**Thoughts:** This was my first real exposure to using APIs and it was definitely an interesting learning experience. I feel like I've got a pretty good grasp on the various AJAX/jQuery/vanilla JS involved in pulling from and posting through an API. Biggest lesson today: slow down! I found myself spending a big too much time banging my head against a wall only to realize it was some small mistake in one of my calls. D'oh! Most of my time was spent trying to troubleshoot through the Github API docs rather than my code, as simple as it was. I'd really love to slim down my code and clean it up. I feel like it may still be more messy than I'd like, but hey it's working!

**Time Spent Today:** 8 hours
**Journey Time** 724 hours

### Day 2: January 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started the day working on some HakerRank problems in JS/Ruby and starting their 30 days of code challenge on top of this! Continued to work through the Flatiron JS and Rails/JS coursework later on. Finished the JS section today by learning how to create simple test with Mocha and Sinon, including spies and stubs/mocks. Transitioned back to Rails and starting to learn how to incorporate JS and make use of the Asset Pipeline. Learned the ins and outs of the AP manifest files and how to incorporate some basic CSS/JS into existing projects. Finished the day creating some basic functionality in an app to import CSV files and manipulate the data from them. 

**Thoughts:** It felt good getting through the rest of the basic JS section. I'd like to spend some freetime looking more into JS and increasing my proficiency. Flatiron skims over quite a bit in their section but I need to increase my knowledge further, i feel like there is so much more I could learn about basic JS usage and flesh out some ideas for my Penda app project. Felt pretty good today, no real roadblocks. Definitely happy to be working with Ruby/Rails again, just feels so natural! Will pickup tomorrow working more with Sidekiq and APIs/AJAX in Rails. 

**Time Spent Today:** 8.5 hours
**Journey Time** 732.5 hours

### Day 3: January 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Got a late start today with some at home issues that popped up this morning. Started off the day by completing Day 1 of 30 Days Of Code (HR) and then some additional JS and Ruby problems for practice. After working with Rails so much it's good to get a refresher on some basic Ruby! Explored the use of Sidekiq a bit, which can be used to move long-running tasks off of the main app's thread and minimize user impact (was working with CSV files again). Worked more with Rails and APIs, mainly leveraging Postman to explore, then using implementing Faraday in my Rails app. Primarliy played around with Foursquare and Github APIs in some simple exercises to create a simple user interface to do custom API hits.

**Thoughts:** Despite the late start I felt like it was a productive day, although I didnt get through as many labs as I'd like to have. Working with various APIs is really interesting but can be a headscratcher sometimes when you cant get it to work the way you want. Make sure you're always checking the small stuff, even something as silly as forgetting to use 'https' instead of 'http'. Feel like I've gotten a better feel for using API documentation.

### Day 4 January 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Typically I dont get as much time in on weekends as I'd like with other obligations, but I wanted to ensure I was at least getting an hour everyday! Spend about and hour and a half working on HackerRank problems to keep myself challenged. Not only did I get to work on some good warmup problems, but I also learned about how to use JS try...catch statements! I can definitely see how they would be handy for error handling in some cases. Also made it through the Day 2 of HR's 30 Days of Code.

**Thoughts:** I feel like these HR or CodeWars challenges are a great daily warm up activity to keep my skills sharp. I've learned A LOT since last August, but these have shown me the importance of keeping on top of some of the basics. Sometimes simple is the right answer, especially from a complexity and run time standpoint. I'm really looking forward to getting into some of the CS concepts and Algorithms. I'd like to start looking into the CS50x coursework.

**Time Spent Today:** 1.5 hours
**Journey Time** 741 hours

### Day 5 January 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Spent my time doing some introductory problems with Algorithms and Data Structures. Definitely took a bit to figure some of the challenges out but they were fun! 

**Thoughts:** Was able to get a bit more done inbetween house work today. Mainly just focused on doing some HackerRank problems, and CodeWars challenges. I find that they're a good way to warm up or challenge myself when I dont have a lot of time to study or commit to a project. Started dealing with triplets and some introductory work with Algorithms and data structures- very interesting! 

**Time Spent Today:** 2 hours
**Journey Time** 743 hours

### Day 6 January 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Mainly spent the day working with various APIs and got practice in making hits and primarily making POST requests. Created a very basic app to let an oauth authenticated user pull a list of their github repos and then create a new repo by entering a name in a text field. Worked with Postman quite a bit too to get some practice additional get/post requests as well. 

**Thoughts:** Definitely feeling more comfortable working with APIs and reading through their documentation. I lost about an hour or so while being stubborn- learning opportunity! In my excitement I misread where you're supposed to request for repo access from a user, and was trying to do it at the time of the post, rather than getting that permission upfront when establishing the user and getting a token. Felt really silly after I realized what was going on, but hey just shows you the importance of taking the time to FULLY read the docs for what you're trying to do and making sure you're in the right section. It really helps to read the getting started section and not just jumping to the parts you're messing with. 

**Time Spent Today:** 9 hours
**Journey Time** 750 hours

### Day 7 January 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about creating web service objects in Rails which help to move some of the API logic outside of the controllers to help your app better adhere to the single responsibility principle. Also start learning to implement AJAX GET/POST requests with Rails to better serve content. Worked on an older app to implement an AJAX post request to create a comment within a project without having to navigate away or lock up the browser. 

**Thoughts:** Rails never ceases to amaze me with all the handy little nuances that make it very user friendly and the asset pipeline has been fun to play with. I'm familiar with some JS (need to learn coffeescript!) and was creating some basic on click functions that would dynamically load a project's comments in the page, or send a post request behind the scenes using AJAX. Still feel like I'm a bit clumsy in creating those requests, but I need to keep learning about how to implement them with my existing application and move some of that out of the Rails stack.
