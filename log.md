# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Flatiron lessons for asynchronous JavaScript. Started with basic XHR and then AJAX/Callbacks and JS' fetch() method using the GitHub API. Spent quite a bit of time practicing with the GitHub API- pulling repos, creating forks, pulling/posting issues/commits, etc.. 

**Thoughts:** This was my first real exposure to using APIs and it was definitely an interesting learning experience. I feel like I've got a pretty good grasp on the various AJAX/jQuery/vanilla JS involved in pulling from and posting through an API. Biggest lesson today: slow down! I found myself spending a big too much time banging my head against a wall only to realize it was some small mistake in one of my calls. D'oh! Most of my time was spent trying to troubleshoot through the Github API docs rather than my code, as simple as it was. I'd really love to slim down my code and clean it up. I feel like it may still be more messy than I'd like, but hey it's working!

**Time Spent Today:** 8 Hours
**Journey Time** 724 hours

**Today's Progress**: Started the day working on some HakerRank problems in JS/Ruby and starting their 30 days of code challenge on top of this! Continued to work through the Flatiron JS and Rails/JS coursework later on. Finished the JS section today by learning how to create simple test with Mocha and Sinon, including spies and stubs/mocks. Transitioned back to Rails and starting to learn how to incorporate JS and make use of the Asset Pipeline. Learned the ins and outs of the AP manifest files and how to incorporate some basic CSS/JS into existing projects. Finished the day creating some basic functionality in an app to import CSV files and manipulate the data from them. 

**Thoughts:** It felt good getting through the rest of the basic JS section. I'd like to spend some freetime looking more into JS and increasing my proficiency. Flatiron skims over quite a bit in their section but I need to increase my knowledge further, i feel like there is so much more I could learn about basic JS usage and flesh out some ideas for my Penda app project. Felt pretty good today, no real roadblocks. Definitely happy to be working with Ruby/Rails again, just feels so natural! Will pickup tomorrow working more with Sidekiq and APIs/AJAX in Rails. 

**Time Spent Today:** 8.5 Hours
**Journey Time** 732.5 hours
