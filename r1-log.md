# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Your Name Here]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 17, Monday, 2017].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started a Weather App. Worked on the draft layout of the app, struggled with OpenWeather API http://www.example.com

### R1D2
### R1D23: June 03, 2019

 **Today's Progress:** Made more progress on my #100DaysOfCode challenge manager application. Spent more time adding additional conditional logic to the github commit form. Planning to spend more time working with BFS/DFS algorithms, really need to brush up there.

 **Thoughts:** Things have been going really well with the application! I think I'm to a point now where it really just needs major styling. Eventually I'd like to refactor and a lot of this logic needs to be moved out of the controllers and into services or factory models (thinking of one for submissions to better handle potential future additions? I'd like to also revisit some of the work done earlier to move Github and Twitter calls out already.

 ### R2D26: 6/4/2019

 **Today's Progress:** Mostly spent adjusting the styling on my 100 days of code challenge manager that I've been working on. 

 **Thoughts:** Just a few steps left! Really need to add an option to edit a user's github repo link to account for new/additional rounds being added to the log.

 ### R2D27: June 6th, 2019

 **Today's Progress:** Did a few kata to start the day. Looked for more job postings in the DFW area. Continued to clean up my #100DaysOfCode challenge manager application. Started revamping user profiles to make use of a form to allow a user to change their github repo if they need to. 

 **Thoughts:** This project has been taking a bit longer than I initially thought it would. There have been a lot of great learning opportunities on this one, but more so than anything, this is another good example of why I really need to get more comfortable with TDD so I dont have to keep doing manual tests.
